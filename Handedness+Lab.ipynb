    "You're currently a data scientist working at a university. A professor of psychology is attempting to study the relationship between personalities and left-handedness. They have tasked you with gathering evidence so that they may publish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the professor says \"I need to prove that left-handedness is caused by some personality trait. Go find that personality trait and the data to back it up.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data scientist, you know that any real data science problem must be **specific** and **conclusively answerable**. For example:\n",
    "- Bad data science problem: \"What is the link between obesity and blood pressure?\"\n",
    "    - This is vague and is not conclusively answerable. That is, two people might look at the conclusion and one may say \"Sure, the problem has been answered!\" and the other may say \"The problem has not yet been answered.\"\n",
    "- Good data science problem: \"Does an association exist between obesity and blood pressure?\"\n",
    "    - This is more specific and is conclusively answerable. The problem specifically is asking for a \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer. Based on that, two independent people should both be able to say either \"Yes, the problem has been answered\" or \"No, the problem has not yet been answered.\"\n",
    "- Excellent data science problem: \"As obesity increases, how does blood pressure change?\"\n",
    "    - This is very specific and is conclusively answerable. The problem specifically seeks to understand the effect of one variable on the other.\n",

    "### 1. In the context of the left-handedness and personality example, what are three specific and conclusively answerable problems that you could answer using data science? \n",

    "Answer: When we want to put our variables on the same scale, we often will standardize them. An explicit example might be predicting income based on GPA and square footage of one's house. If we built a linear regression model predicting income from GPA and square feet, the coefficient from GPA would probably be quite large (because a one-unit change in GPA is substantial) whereas the coefficient from square feet would probably be quite small (because a one-unit change in square feet is almost negligible). If we plan to regularize, the GPA coefficient will be penalized just because it's large whereas the square feet coefficient will probably not be affected much at all.\n",

    "In the context of $k$-nearest neighbors, it's especially important to standardize our variables. If we're trying to see which observations are \"close\" to one another and we have two variables that are on very different scales, then one variable will make observations look close to one another. For example, observations will look close based on GPA but far away based on square footage. The nearest neighbors will be almost entirely determined by square footage and not by GPA. "
